**Question:** What tasks/areas of machine learning are you familiar with or have you worked with?
**Answer:** I am basically familiar with classification, linear and logistic regression, decision trees. I am familiar with the basic architectures of neural networks, I have trained CNNs and fully connected neural networks, used regularization, fine-tuning of models, I understand conv and upconv layers, I have studied the work of the main optimizers. I have experience in image classification, I have also trained semantic segmentation via CNN. I am slightly familiar with detection, anchors. I had student experience in writing and training autoencoders and GANs. As a diploma project for the digital department, the team and I made a service for segmenting oil spills on water using YOLOv11.

**Question:** Are you familiar with Agile, Scrum or other methodologies?
**Answer:** I am slightly familiar with Agile and Scrum, but I can't explain the whole essence. I only know that the work is done in modules with the transfer of tasks, Kanban boards are actively used.

**Question:** What are your key strengths (Soft Skills)?
**Answer:** I am a very sociable person, empathetic, I can find a common language with anyone, calm, not aggressive. I approach solving complex problems with a cool head and deep planning. I have experience working in a team of 10 people as a team lead. I am kind, I like to dig deep into problems, into architectures and how things work under the hood. I do not depend on the opinions of others (self-confident), but at the same time I accept constructive criticism. It's easy to negotiate with me, I'm responsible.

## Part 3: Experience and Projects

**Question:** Have you had any internships related to development or machine learning?
**Answer:** I haven't had any internships yet.

**Question:** Have you participated in any university projects where you had a clear role and responsibilities similar to a job?
**Answer:** Yes. The project from the government Priority 2030 "Digital Department" is now coming to an end. As part of which I studied at the program of remote sensing of the earth (RSE), studied the full cycle of project development, sensing methods, backend architecture, training of computer vision models. At the end, for six months, it was necessary to make a project for a diploma in a team of 10 people. I was in the role of a team lead, assembled a team based on psychological compatibility, soft and hard skills, held meetings, management was conducted according to Agile. I thought over the architecture of the project for the segmentation of oil slicks in photographs from a drone. There were 3 departments: backend, ml and front. In addition to managing and coordinating tasks, I actively participated in the development and training of the YOLOv11 model, and wrote a separate microservice for the application on which the model is launched and segmentation takes place on FastAPI.
*   **Position:** Teamlead, AI Engineer
*   **Dates:** 01.12.2024 - 23.06.2025
*   **Result:** We have developed a service for fast and convenient segmentation of archives with photographs of water surfaces from a drone, using YOLOv11, Next.js, FastAPI, which has led to convenient, fast and cheap segmentation, as this model has not been seen in this task before.

**Question:** Have you completed freelance orders or participated in commercial projects?
**Answer:** Yes, most likely it fits the description of freelance. From February to the present day, I have been participating in the development of a telegram bot for a startup (I cannot disclose the details at the request of the founder), I am not working officially. My tasks include developing the server side of the bot on Aiogram. It is connected with artificial intelligence, I think over the logic of user interaction with the bot, experiment with models and develop prompts. In the near future I will be implementing RAG memory. B2B bot for automating communication between the employer and new employees, their autonomous supervision and training in the restaurant business.
*   **Position:** Backend Python, AI Engineer, Promt Engineer
*   **Dates:** 10.02.2025 - present

## Part 4: Education and Achievements

**Question:** Do you have any other personal or educational projects?
**Answer:** I don't have any solo pet projects yet, I'll be doing that now.

**Question:** Have you participated in Kaggle competitions?
**Answer:** Yes, I participated in a Kaggle competition on the classification of the Simpsons using CNN. I took 3rd place in the F1-score metric.
*   **Description of the approach:** As part of the competition, I developed and trained a model for classifying images of 42 characters from the animated series "The Simpsons". My approach was comprehensive and included several key techniques to achieve maximum accuracy.
*   **Model selection and training strategy (Transfer Learning):** As a basis, I used the modern and effective convolutional neural network EfficientNetV2-S, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. I applied a strategy of gradual unfreezing of layers.
*   **Combating class imbalance:** I used the Focal Loss function and weighted sampling (WeightedRandomSampler).
*   **Advanced augmentation and regularization:** I used a wide range of augmentations from Albumentations and the MixUp technique.

Now I am doing the final project of this course on approaches and methods of face recognition. Training dates: 27.01.2025 - 13.07.2025.

**Question:** Do you have any awards (hackathons, olympiads)?
**Answer:** I recently participated for the first time in the "Vibe-hackathon" from the Friflex company. The case was to develop a mini-game for the Energogarant insurance company. There were 3 hours, during which time a team of 3 people had to develop a layout, design, the working application itself and prepare a product presentation using neural networks. We did not win, the status is "participant".
